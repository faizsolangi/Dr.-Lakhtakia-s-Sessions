## 🟦 Prompt 2 — AI Research Assistant

```markdown
You are an expert AI engineer and Python/Streamlit developer.
Your task is to generate a **complete, production-ready AI application** using 
**Streamlit + OpenAI API**, fully deployable on **Render**.

This application must use the **P.E.A.C.E. Prompt Framework** for all LLM interactions:
P — Purpose  
E — Expectations  
A — Actions  
C — Constraints  
E — Evaluation  

Whenever you create an LLM prompt, structure it explicitly using these five sections.

=====================================================
APP — AI Research Assistant (Render-ready)
=====================================================

FEATURES (must include all of the following):
- Text input for research topic (or abstract)
- Optional input for field/discipline (e.g., Materials Science, CS, Education)
- Uses LLM to generate:
    - A concise academic **Summary**
    - A list of **Research gaps**
    - **Methodology suggestions**
    - A **Related work overview**
    - Example **APA-style references**
- Structured outputs with clear headings
- Clean Streamlit layout
- Option to download the generated overview as Markdown

=====================================================
LLM PROMPT REQUIREMENTS (use PEACE Framework)
=====================================================

For the core LLM call that acts as the research assistant, build the prompt using PEACE:

P — Purpose:  
    Assist the researcher by generating a structured academic overview of the given topic.

E — Expectations:  
    Provide concise but detailed academic sections with:
    - A 150–250 word summary
    - 3–6 research gaps
    - 3–5 methodology suggestions
    - A short related work overview
    - 5–8 example APA-style references

A — Actions:  
    - Summarize the topic  
    - Identify important gaps and open questions  
    - Propose methodologies (experimental, computational, theoretical, mixed)  
    - Outline related work themes  
    - Provide realistic but not fabricated APA-style references

C — Constraints:  
    - Avoid confidently fabricated citations (titles/authors/years)  
    - It’s acceptable to provide **generic** / **approximate** references, but label them as examples if needed  
    - Use real methods and terminology appropriate to the field  
    - If there is insufficient information, say “insufficient data” or state assumptions clearly  
    - Maintain an academic tone and structure

E — Evaluation:  
    Output must:
    - Follow an academic tone  
    - Use headings for each section:
      - Summary
      - Research Gaps
      - Methodology Suggestions
      - Related Work Overview
      - Example References (APA)  
    - Be logically coherent and helpful to a graduate student or early-stage researcher  

You must implement this PEACE prompt explicitly as a string in the code and pass it to the OpenAI API.

=====================================================
SHARED CODING REQUIREMENTS
=====================================================

Generate:

1. A full `app.py` file that:
   - Uses **Streamlit** for UI
   - Uses the **OpenAI Python SDK** with this pattern:
         from openai import OpenAI
         client = OpenAI(api_key=st.secrets["OPENAI_API_KEY"])
   - Loads the API key from `st.secrets["OPENAI_API_KEY"]` (Render-compatible)
   - Includes basic error handling (e.g., missing key, API failure)
   - Has clear comments explaining:
       - UI fields
       - LLM call
       - PEACE prompt construction
   - Provides a **Download as Markdown** button for the generated overview
   - Runs without modification when deployed on Render

2. A `requirements.txt` file containing exactly:
   streamlit  
   openai  
   pandas  
   matplotlib  

   (Even if not all are used, keep it identical to the other app for simplicity.)

3. A **Render Deployment Guide** that includes:
   - Build command:
         pip install -r requirements.txt
   - Start command:
         streamlit run app.py --server.port $PORT --server.address 0.0.0.0
   - Instruction to set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in Render’s Environment variables

=====================================================
FINAL OUTPUT FORMAT
